It was a rare Friday night without an insane amount of homework.  There was a gloriously tiny stack of papers piled up on my desk that I had been working on when my friend sent me a message through Gmail.A video titled, “Can We Autocorrect Humanity?” popped open when I clicked on the link he sent me. A video of a man delivering a spoken word poem with a passion about the world’s addiction to smartphones and social media began playing.
People have told me many times that we are becoming too closely attached to our computer screens and phones. Whether it be for school work, texting, social media, or just for fun, people spend hours of their day checking their phones or computers. I’m guilty of doing the same thing. We all have those friends that always have their phone out, who, instead of listening to you when you speak, are constantly checking Facebook, or their text messages. I’ve been that person. But I want to change that. I want people to listen to each other when they are talking, to enjoy a moment without taking a picture, to make jokes without needing to reference internet memes, to connect to each other beyond their computer screen.
