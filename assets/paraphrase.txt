On a rare Friday night without a huge amount of homework, I worked on the gloriously small stack of papers piled up on my desk. My friend suddenly sent me a message on Gmail. I opened the link in his message, and a video with the title, “Can We Autocorrect Humanity?” popped open. It was a man, passionately delivering a spoken word poem, about people’s addiction to smartphones and social media.
I have often been told that we are becoming too reliant on our phones and computer screens. Some spend long hours looking at their screens, whether for school work, instant messaging, social media, or playing games. I’ve done the same thing. We all have that one friend that constantly has their phone out, checking Facebook or their texts instead of listening. I’ve been there. But I’d like to change that. I want people to hear each other when speaking and connect beyond a computer screen. I want them to enjoy moments without taking pictures and to make jokes without referencing internet memes.
