On a rare Friday evening, one without a large amount of work. I was working on the amazingly short stack of assignments I had piled onto my desk. My friend sent a message to my phone. I tapped on the link in the message he sent, and a video called, “Can We Autocorrect Humans?” popped open. It was a video of a man reciting his spoken word poem about everyone’s addiction to smartphones and online media with fervor. 
There have been numerous times when my parents have told me that I am becoming too closely attached to my phone and computer screens. Some spend hours of their days staring at their screens, whether it’s for school work, messaging, social media, or only for fun. I’m guilty of this too. We all have that friend that always has their phone out, checking Twitter, or a text message, instead of paying attention to you when you talk. I was that person. But I’m trying to change that. I would like people to listen to their friends when they are talking, contact each other away from their computer screens, to enjoy moments without taking pictures, to make joke without referencing internet memes.
