On a nice Friday evening, one with not much homework, I was working on a gloriously small stack of homework I had stacked up onto my table when a friend sent me a text on Gmail. I clicked open the link inside the message, and some video titled, “Can I Autocorrect Humans?” popped up. It was a video of a man reciting his spoken word poetry about the world’s need for smartphones and online media with a fervor. 
There have often been times when adults have told us that we have become too attached to our smartphones and laptop screens. Some spend chunks of their day staring at a screen, maybe for homework, texting, online media, or even for fun. I am guilty of the exact same thing.Everyone has those friends that constantly have a phone out, scrolling through Facebook or reading text messages, rather than listening to people when they speak. I have been that guy. But I would like to change that. I’d like people to hear to each other while they are speaking, connect to others beyond a computer screen, and to remember a moment without snapping a picture, and to crack jokes without having to reference online memes.
