It was a rare Friday night, one without an insane amount of homework. I had been working on the gloriously tiny stack of papers I had piled up on my desk when my friend sent me a message through Gmail. I clicked on the link in the message, and a video titled, “Can We Autocorrect Humanity?” popped open. It was the video of the man delivering his spoken word poem about the world’s addiction to smartphones and social media with a passion. 
There have been many times when people have told me that we are becoming too closely attached to our phones and computer screens. People spend hours of their day looking at a screen, whether it be for school work, texting, social media, or just for fun. I’m guilty of doing the same thing. We all have those friends that always have their phone out, checking Facebook or their text messages, instead of listening to you when you speak. I’ve been that person. But I want to change that. I want people to listen to each other when they are talking, connect to each other beyond their computer screen, to enjoy a moment without taking a picture, to make jokes without needing to reference internet memes.
