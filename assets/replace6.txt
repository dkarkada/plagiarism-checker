On a rare Friday night, without an insane amount of work, I was working on the gloriously short stack of papers I had stacked up on my desk. Suddenly, my friend sent me a text through Gmail. I opened the link in the message, and a video called, “Can We Autocorrect Humanity?” opened up. It was a video of a man reciting a spoken word poem about people’s addiction to smartphones and online media with a fervor. 
There have been many occasions when adults have told me that millennials are becoming too attached to our phones and laptop screens. People spend hours and hours looking at a screen. It could be for school work, messaging, social media, or just for games. I’m guilty of doing the exact same thing. We all have some friends that always have their phones out, checking Facebook or reading text messages, instead of paying attention to you when you talk. I’ve been that person. But I would like to change that. I want everyone to listen to others when they are speaking, connect to others beyond their computer screen, to have a moment without snapping a picture, and to make jokes not needing to reference memes.
