Parallels are terrifying. I don’t mean the geometry concept that makes up parallelograms and confusing angle problems. I mean parallel tosses. Tosses where you purposefully take a six foot long pole with a flag taped onto the end of it and throw it above your head, hoping that it will spin parallel to the ground before it comes back down. All the while praying that it doesn’t break your face when it does. 
This is all I remember of the first time I attempted to throw a parallel:
Blood dripping between my fingers, splattering the tiles. Scarlet droplets stain my gloves maroon. Pain lances through the bridge of my nose. My glasses clatter to the floor, one of their lenses popping out. I can’t remember falling to my knees, but I am already kneeling, as if bowing. Someone tells me to lie down. Tilt my head up. Breathe through my mouth. But blood pools in the back of my throat, and I struggle to breathe normally. Hours, minutes, in reality, probably only seconds later, someone is helping me stagger to my feet, holding a paper towel up to my face, leading me to the bathroom to wash off the blood.
These images now flash through my mind every time I toss the six foot flag above my head. The bruise on my nose from that day still has not faded though it’s been nearly a month. And in practicing parallels, I’ve gained several more bruises along my legs, arms, and even neck to add to the collection.
